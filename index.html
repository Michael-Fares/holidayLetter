        <p class="intro">Season's Greetings to all! This is what the Lane-Fares family has been up to in 2022:</p>

                This year, Jess has continued to rock the OG pink hair lifestyle looked up to by many a younger woman in whose demographic said style has since become popular - yet only wishes she could emulate Jess's. In fact, Michael pretty much expects at least one admiring gen Z-er to stop Jess and inquire about her hair secrets every time they go to their favorite local hangout, or even the grocery store.

                Jess has also made her and Michael's new humble Houston suburban abode a true home by filling it with the amazing results of myriad new hobbies. Just some of these include growing delicious tomatoes, cultivating rare houseplants, and tending to her fish tank.
                
                Jess has also become quite the international gourmet cook this past year, having perfected meals like Italian chicken marsala, Greek chicken and potatoes, and Arabic lentil soup better than any Michael has ever made.  

                Jess has in addition kept up her mainstay of Yoga teaching, offering a weekly chair yoga class for seniors at a local community center. She continues to be an inspiration and embodiment of the idea that anyone of any age or ability can grow stronger through exercise. Speaking of strength training, Jess has been laser focused on her own fitness goals and started seeing a personal trainer with whom she's been racking up some serious hours at the gym. Michael really had better shape up, man.

            In 2022 Michael set out to reach his goal of becoming a full time coder. Unsurprisingly, Michael was quickly successful in finding a coding job leading him to hang up his Arabic professor hat in the Spring after finishing the last semester of his 10 year stay at UH. In May Michael joined Learnosity where he has found a place that allows him to utilize his new skills as a coder and his past experience as an educator. He now spends his days working from home under the direct supervision of Socks who spends most afternoons stationed behind Michael’s computer monitor only taking breaks to eat or provide Michael with stress-relieving cuddles.
            Outside of work, Michael has revisited his hobbies like gardening and playing more music which have provided Jess with both home-grown veggies and a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGKeeVDwNlA">Michael J. Fares album.</a>

        <h4>Socks</h4>
        <p>
            2022 seemed to be off to a rocky start for Socks as Jess and Michael added an energetic puppy to the family in January. Faced with his new reality, Socks prepared himself for constant unwanted chases by settling back into the upstairs crawl space; however, things took a turn for the better when socks realized that the humans had installed a doggie gate giving him both free reign of the upstairs portion of the house and access to the primary bedroom downstairs so as not to prevent him from using Jess as his personal nighttime heater. 

            True to his feline nature - which was encouraged by the promise of treats, Socks became more and more curious about the lively pup and thus, made efforts to scale the doggie gate in order to come face-to-face with the creature. Socks regretted the majority of these encounters… until one day he didn’t. 
            
            Socks now spends his days freely roaming the entirety of the house. He enjoys his morning treat followed by a play session with his sister Stella and enjoys his evenings cuddling next to her after, especially after indulging in his catnip provided by his cat dad. He’s even realized that stella makes a much better night heater than Jess.

        <h4>Stella</h4>
           
        <p>
            Stella ingratiated herself into the Fares-Lane household this year from the very first moment we laid eyes on her back in January - when Jess could not resist her picture and made what turned out to be a great a last minute decision to adopt her. On most days you can find Stella following Jess and Michael everywhere waiting for any opportunity to play fetch, tug of war, or incessantly chase a laser pointer until she can’t resist sleep. You might also find her trying to join in on Jess’s Aerial Yoga session, or on a 3 mile morning run with Michael - much to her chagrin. But failing that she’s perfectly content with chasing and play fighting with Socks. Jess trained her to be such a good and obedient dog, and during the times she still gets into mischief, luckily for Michael Stella is just too sweet and cute to stay mad at. We love her and are grateful for the joy she brings us every day.
